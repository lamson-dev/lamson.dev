description: jet lagged, can't sleep, so naturally I'm reviving my dead website from my phone
---

Happy 2026.

I'm back from Hong Kong. The trip was great. The jet lag? Still here. It's been over a week. Am I getting older? Probably. Let's not dwell on that.

So here I am, 6am, lying in bed, doom-scrolling through AI news because my brain refuses to let me sleep. And then a thought: *can I actually code from my phone now?*

Turns out, yes. Kind of.

I dusted off this site, upgraded all the dependencies, fixed the broken auto-deployment, and now I'm writing this post. All from bed. If you're reading this, it worked. Wild.

Anyway, let's see if my $200 investment was worth it.

Cheers to growth, jet lag, and questionable life choices.
