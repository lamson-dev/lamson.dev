Hey! My name is Sơn. I was born and raised in Sài Gòn, Việt Nam. I went abroad to the U.S. to pursue a college degree.

I’ve been happy to call Seattle, WA my home for the past 10 years. I’m married to a loving and supportive partner, and I’m a proud paw-rent to an adorable mini-poodle.

If you've come to this page, you're probably curious to learn more about me. Welcome!

I'll take you on a journey to share a glimpse into my story.

## Developer 🧑🏼‍💻

I have over 10 years of experience in developing and engineering software applications. I have a strong passion for frontend architecture and cloud-native solutions.

Throughout my career, I have worked on various projects including developing iOS and Android mobile apps, building API services, creating test automation frameworks, implementing multi-currency and internationalization features, migrating source control systems, transitioning monolith architectures to micro-services, and establishing foundations for teams to build and deploy UI applications and their services, at scale.

I am also a technology evangelist. I have [developed and evangelized new design system with React components library](https://www.apptio.com/blog/apex-the-new-look-and-feel-for-apptio-products/), and designed a micro-frontend framework to integrate multiple products into [a single cohesive product suite](https://www.apptio.com/blog/apptio-announces-simple-powerful-product-suite/). Additionally, I have helped teams and enterprise software companies improve their velocity by implementing robust and secure multi-cloud infrastructure on Kubernetes platform, and assisting them in achieving SOC2 compliance.

Currently, I am investing my energy on learning about Large Language Models and developing software that would be helpful for people.

## Entrepreneur 🧗🏼

I co-founded [Printopus](https://www.facebook.com/printopus.vn) with my brother as a side project. It is a family fun business. Printopus is a mobile and web application that enables users to transform their precious moments captured in digital photos into beautifully packaged prints and picture frames. These items can be delivered directly to the users or given as gifts to their friends and family.

We stopped investing in Printopus because of life events. But hey, it was just my first company and I'm still counting.

## Visionary ⛰️

I envision myself leading a tight-knit technology business where team members have strong bonds and a supportive work environment. Imagine a lively coffee shop (owned by my family) serving as our workspace. In this vibrant setting, we get to work on exciting projects driven by passion and a shared vision of creating value for people. I will be surrounded by a team of talented individuals, carefully chosen based on meaningful connections I have made throughout my life. Together, we will not only build innovative solutions and push technological boundaries but also create a work atmosphere filled with laughter, freshly baked pastries (by my wife), and a sense of belonging. Sounds like a dream?

> I actually had dreams about this. Be sure to catch up with me in a few years. We’ll likely meet at my coffee shop ;)
